# Caesar Cipher - A Basic Ruby Implementation

## Brief Description of Project:

This project runs in the terminal.

User input: a message (string) to encrypt and a key/shift (integer)

Output: an encrypted message (encrypted using a Caesar cipher)

## What I Learned:

The point of this mini-project was to become familiar with basic Ruby syntax.

It was also nice practice with using the Pry-byebug Gem and with refactoring.
